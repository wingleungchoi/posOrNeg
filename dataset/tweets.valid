__label__0 @corykad the field rep from geb was there. chances are if i did something bad, guiding eyes'd hear about it.  else, i wouldn't care much..
__label__1 @corykennedy gonna make me feel guilty for loving that movie?
__label__0 @coryocconor i can't make it happen.  it's just the way the story goes, and once in a while, you take the defeat.

__label__1 @counternotions talk is cheap.
__label__1 @counternotions wow....are you serious?! now we're learning something about this mystery man from the department of reality.
__label__1 @counternotions you just need a # silly, not a card
